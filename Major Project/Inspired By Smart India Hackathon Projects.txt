Page 55  543  Build a solution that is able to undertake Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on handwritten text in Hindi language. The result should be the equivalent text typed in Hindi with over ~70% accuracy. Solution must address issues such as non-standard ways of writing and poor handwriting.

Description	"Digitization of Hindi handwritten text overcoming challenges like poor and non standard handwriting is the key focus area of this problem statement. There is immense potential for these paper-based documents to be intelligently digitized. This means going beyond scanning and simply retaining a soft copy, to actually converting the scanned copy into searchable and editable documents automatically without requiring any manual analysis and data entry. Build a solution that is able to undertake accurate OCR on handwritten text in Hindi language. • Challenges that arise due to non-standard ways of writing should be overcome."
